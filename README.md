# Inventory-Management-System
An inventory management system built in python using JSON. 
This project uses json library to manage the inventory of a cafe. 
Inventory is recorded and updated in records.json file.
After every purchase a sales report is generated and appended into the sales2.txt
Modify the records.json file to add as many products you need.

## How to run the files :
1. Download all three files on your system. [Make sure all three are in same directory].
2. Next open the Jupyter Notebook file and just run it.
3. You can also run the code as a .py file just make sure to create a new py file with the code from the ipynb file you downloaded.

## To add more products in JSON File :
Add your products into json file by giving them a different key from the ones already existing.
You can also modify the prices and quantity as per your needs

## Converting sales.txt to csv
If on a Linux or MacOS system, just rename the file to .csv and tabular form is good to go.
For Windows system, you'll have to use excel to convert the text file into csv.

## Future works
Can be deployed to handle real cafe(or any kind of store) inventory management.
